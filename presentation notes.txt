Transitioned from JSON Server to Spring backend

What went wrong? 
* Changing name conventions
* Fields not mapping into the right place
* Postman push not working
* All the things I had to troubleshoot
* Edit - still pulling the correct selected property data but not going anywhere
* Garden - kept defaulting to No garden regardless of what we entered

Project Management - did we use JIRA/Miro? 
Testing - look at code coverage (MockMvc testing)
Extra features
Re-do the front end to potentially cut down on requests
Integrate the back-end with Jenkins
